# üåê TopoNetX (TNX) üç©
# Computing with Relational Data abstracted as Topological Domains



This branch is forked from the TNX on [pyt-team](https://github.com/pyt-team). One can genereate topological network with  it. I modified the original library due to the following reasons.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main features

1. Unlilke Original TNX, this code does not change the sequece order. 
2. The original library  has exponential time complexity with respect to sequence length. The modified version here has a linear complexity.
